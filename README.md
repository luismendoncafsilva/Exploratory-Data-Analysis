# Exploratory Data Analysis
 Exploratory data analysis focusing on customer segmentation from a marketing standpoint.

This project showcases an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflow using Python, inspired by the Ifood challenge from EBA - Statistics from Basic to Advanced course. The goal is to analyze the structure, quality, and patterns in a dataset, preparing it for further modeling and insights generation.

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`EDA.ipynb`) demonstrating the essential steps in a comprehensive EDA process, including:

- **Data Loading and Overview:** Importing the dataset and understanding its structure.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summary statistics and distribution analysis.
- **Data Visualization:** Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features and transforming existing ones for better insights.

### Key Questions Addressed
- How many rows and columns are present in the dataset?
- Which columns are numerical?
- Are there duplicates? 
- Are there missing values? What do they indicate?
- What are the key statistics (mean, median, percentiles) for numerical columns?
- What is the income distribution among customers?
- How do marital status and number of children relate?
- Do people spend more or less on our platform when they have children?
- Is there a correlation between income and expenses?


## Requirements
