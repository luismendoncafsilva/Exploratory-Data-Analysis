# Exploratory Data Analysis and Hypothesis testing
 Exploratory data analysis focusing on customer segmentation from a marketing standpoint.

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focusing on hypothesis testing using python, inspired by the Ifood challenge from EBA - Statistics from Basic to Advanced course. The primary goal is to uncover patterns, outliers, and assumptions about the dataset, followed by statistical testing to validate these insights.

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`EDA.ipynb`) demonstrating the essential steps in a comprehensive EDA process, including:

- **Data Analysis:** Cleaning, transforming, and visualizing the dataset.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Using statistical tests to verify assumptions.
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is included in the notebook.
